## What is cloud computing

fundamentally cloud computing is the on demand availability of computing resources without the maintainance of necessary hardware for the end user. In particular, data storage  where the proportion stored on he cloud has grown to 60% of corporate data by 2022 and is still rapidly increasing.
A cloud functions by keeping its data in large centralised datacenters and connecting with end users to provide this data on demand in  a secure manner. Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications.
